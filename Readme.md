## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using Foursquare data to create a recommendation engine for restaurants in Chicago.  My goal was to create the engine then generate recommendations for a user from the data pulled from Foursqaure.

## File Descriptions

* Several versions of the Jupyter notebook used before importing the project to GitHub
* CCASF12010CMAP.xlsx - Excel file of Chicago neighborhood data
* Other Excel files were exported from Jupyter notebook.

## Results

I was able to create a recommendation engine for restaurants in Chicago.  Due to the restrictions on API calls for a free account, I was not able to access some of the information that could have made the model better.
