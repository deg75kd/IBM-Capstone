## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using Foursquare data to create a recommendation engine for restaurants in Chicago.  My goal was to create the engine then generate recommendations for a user from the data pulled from Foursqaure.

## File Descriptions

* CCASF12010CMAP.xlsx - Excel file of Chicago neighborhood data
* ChiCatOneHot.xlsx - Dataframe after applying one-hot encoding saved to Excel file
* Chicago Restaurant Recommender System - Final.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook of work
* Chicago Restaurant Recommender System Presentation.pdf - Presentation saved as pdf
* Chicago Restaurant Recommender System Report.pdf - Report of findings
* Chicago Restaurant Recommender System.pptx - PowerPoint presentation
* ChicagoVenues.xlsx - Venue data pulled from Foursquare API saved to Excel file

## Results

I was able to create a recommendation engine for restaurants in Chicago.  Due to the restrictions on API calls for a free account, I was not able to access some of the information that could have made the model better.
